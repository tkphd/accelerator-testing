 \brief Specify which stencil (mask) to use for the Laplacian (convolution)

 The mask corresponding to the numerical code will be applied. The suggested
 encoding is mask width as the ones digit and value count as the tens digit,
 \a e.g. 53 specifies five_point_Laplacian_stencil(), while
 93 specifies nine_point_Laplacian_stencil().

 To add your own mask (stencil), add a case to this function with your
 chosen numerical encoding, then specify that code in the input parameters file
 (params.txt by default). Note that, for a Laplacian stencil, the sum of the
 coefficients must equal zero and \a nm must be an odd integer.

 If your stencil is larger than \f$ 5\times 5\f$, you must increase the values
 defined by #MAX_MASK_W and #MAX_MASK_H.
