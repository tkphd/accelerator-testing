 \brief Perform the convolution of the mask matrix with the composition matrix

 If the convolution mask is the Laplacian stencil, the convolution evaluates
 the discrete Laplacian of the composition field. Other masks are possible, for
 example the Sobel filters for edge detection. This function is general
 purpose: as long as the dimensions \a nx, \a ny, and \a nm are properly specified,
 the convolution will be correctly computed.
