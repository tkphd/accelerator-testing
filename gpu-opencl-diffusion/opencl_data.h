 \brief Container for GPU array pointers and parameters

 From the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/opencl-1.2.pdf">OpenCL v1.2</a> spec:
 - A \a Context is the environment within which the kernels execute and the domain in which
   synchronization and memory management is defined. The context includes a set of devices, the
   memory accessible to those devices, the corresponding memory properties and one or more
   command-queues used to schedule execution of a kernel(s) or operations on memory objects.
 - A \a Program \a Object encapsulates the following information:
   - A reference to an associated context.
   - A program source or binary.
   - The latest successfully built program executable, the list of devices for which the program
     executable is built, the build options used and a build log.
   - The number of kernel objects currently attached.
 - A \a Kernel \a Object encapsulates a specific \c __kernel function declared in a
   program and the argument values to be used when executing this \c __kernel function.
